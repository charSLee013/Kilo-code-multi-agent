### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the Framework**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mnehmos/Advanced-Multi-Agent-AI-Framework.git
cd Advanced-Multi-Agent-AI-Framework
```

**2. Configure AI Team Modes**
```bash
# Copy configuration templates
cp templates/custom_modes.yaml ./
cp templates/custom-instructions-for-all-modes.md ./
cp templates/enhance-prompt-template.md ./
```

**3. Deploy to Kilo Code**
- Open Kilo Code → "Modes" → "Edit Project Modes" or "Global Modes"
- copy `custom_modes.yaml` configuration from template and paste into kilocode settings
- Configure custom instructions for all modes by copy and pasting into the Teams settings "Custom Instructions for all Modes"
- Do the same for enhance prompt template into the prompts tab of the srttings window. 
- Save and activate framework

**4. Start Orchestrating**
- Switch to **Orchestrator Mode**
- Describe your project requirements
- Generate Task Map using enhance prompt (✨ button)
- Let the AI team execute with full coordination
